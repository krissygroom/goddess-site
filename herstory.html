                    <p>&quot;The Triple Goddess is the subject of much of the writing of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Goddess">Robert Graves</a>, and has been adopted by many neopagans as one of their primary deities. The term triple goddess is infrequently used outside of Neopaganism to instead refer to historical goddess triads and single goddesses of three forms or aspects. In common Neopagan usage the three female figures are frequently described as the Maiden, the Mother, and the Crone, each of which symbolizes both a separate stage in the female life cycle and a phase of the moon, and often rules one of the realms of earth, underworld, and the heavens.</p>
                    <p>Modern neo-pagan conceptions of the Triple Goddess have been heavily influenced by the prominent early and middle 20th-century poet, novelist and mythographer Robert Graves who regarded the Triple Goddess as the continuing muse of all true poetry and who speculatively reconstructed her ancient worship, drawing on the scholarship of his time</p>
                    <p>More recently the prominent archaeologist <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marija_Gimbutas">Marija Gimbutas</a> has argued for the ancient worship of a Triple Goddess in Europe, attracting much controversy, and her ideas also influence modern neo-paganism.</p>
                    <p>Scholar Marija Gimbutas's theories relating to goddess-centered culture among pre-Indo-European "Old Europe" (6500-3500 BCE) have been widely adopted by New Age and ecofeminist groups. She had been referred to as the &quot;Grandmother of the Goddess Movement&quot; in the 1990s. Gimbutas postulated that in &quot;Old Europe&quot;, the Aegean and the Near East, a great Triple Goddess was worshipped, predating what she deemed as a patriarchal religion imported by the Kurgans, nomadic speakers of Indo-European languages.&quot;</p>

                    <h3>Archetypes and Symbolism</h3>
                    <p>&quot;While many Neopagans are not Wiccan, and within Neopaganism the practices and theology vary widely, many Wiccans and other neopagans worship the "Triple Goddess" of maiden, mother, and crone, a practice going back to mid-twentieth-century England. In their view, sexuality, pregnancy, breastfeeding — and other female reproductive processes — are ways that women may embody the Goddess, making the physical body sacred.</p>
                    <p>The Maiden represents enchantment, inception, expansion, the promise of new beginnings, birth, youth and youthful enthusiasm, represented by the waxing moon&#59;</p>
                    <p>The Mother represents ripeness, fertility, sexuality, fulfilment, stability, power and life represented by the full moon&#59;</p>
                    <p>The Crone represents wisdom, repose, death, and endings represented by the waning moon.&quot;</p>

                    <h3>The Queen&#58;&nbsp;Completing the Cycle</h3>
                    <p>The Triple Goddess archetype and mythology are considered by some feminist scholars and spiritual communities to be incomplete in encompassing the fullness of women's cycles and therefore the addition of the&#32;&quot;Queen&quot;&#32;phase has emerged in Women's Spirituality circles.</p>
                    <p>Author Barbara Ardinger likens a woman's cycles to the four phases of the moon rather than a triple goddess archetype. She described her reasoning for including a fourth phase in the following quote&#58;
                
                    <p>&quot;We like to think that the moon has three phrases&#58; New Moon, Full Moon, Dark Moon. These are said to correspond to the maiden, mother, and crone.</p>
                    <p>But the moon clearly has four phases: Waxing, Full, Waning, and Dark. The New Moon is actually the very beginning of the Waxing phase. Keeping our thinking symmetrical, if we see only three lunar phases, we also like to allot only three phases to a woman’s life. But these days life is a lot more complicated than that.</p>
                    <p>A woman’s life in the 21st century is too complex to fit into simple formulas. Life is too long for a mere three stages. We cannot look to the &quot;ancient wisdom&quot; for solutions to modern issues.</p>
                    <p>Today, at least in the developed countries, women commonly live twenty or thirty years past natural menopause. What this means is that we need to acknowledge and name the fourth phase of life — the phase between motherhood and cronehood. I propose that before getting to crone, women spend a couple of decades as queens. When we finally get the kids out of the house, we find ourselves at the top of our game. Thanks to the wonders of modern medicine, both allopathic and holistic, we’re healthier. If we’re working in the corporate world, we reach upper management; many women leap off the corporate ladder, however, and successfully open their own businesses. Because we’ve already lived fifty years, we have experience, knowledge, and wisdom.</p>
                    <p>We’re queens, and we deserve to be proud of it.&quot;</p>

                    <p>Dr. Anita Johnston, author and clinical psychologist, is also an advocate for including &quot;Queen&quot; as a stage within women's life cycles. She describes these phases as &quot;Soul Cycles&quot; and defines the Four Faces of the Sacred Feminine as &quot;archetypes that correspond to four significant phases in a woman’s life (maiden, mother, queen, crone) and also correspond to the four seasons of the year (spring, summer, fall, winter), four cycles of the moon (waxing, full, waning, dark), four directions (east, south, west, north), four times of day (dawn, noon, dusk, midnight) and four elements (air, fire, water, earth). These archetypal energies are available to the conscious woman for personal growth and healing -- regardless of her chronological age.&quot;</p>

            <p>&quot;Over time, we have seen the feminine instinctive nature looted, driven back, and overbuilt.  For long periods it has been mismanaged like the wildlife and the wildlands.  For several thousand years, as soon and as often as we turn our backs, it is relegated to the poorest land in the psyche.  The spiritual lands of Wild Woman have, throughout history, been plundered or burnt, dens bull-dozed, and natural cycles forced into unnatural rhythms to please others.</p>
            <p>It's not by accident that the pristine wilderness of our planet disappears as the understanding of our own inner wild natures fades.  It is not so difficult to comprehend why old forests and old women are viewed as not very important resources.  It is not such a mystery.  It is not so coincidental that wolves and coyotes, bears and wildish women have similar reputations.  They all share related instinctual archetypes, and as such, both are erroneously reputed to be ingracious, wholly and innately dangerous, and ravenous.</p>
            <p>Fairy tales, myths, and stories provide understandings which sharpen our sight so that we can pick out and pick up the path left by the wildish nature.  The instruction found in story reassures us that the path has not run out, but still leads women deeper, and more deeply still, into their own knowing.  The tracks we all are following are those of the wild and innate instinctual Self.</p>
