                <p>&quot;The Crone is the ancient, wizened part of us that carries the stillness of Winter, deep inner knowing, truth, and connection to the cosmos and our ancestors. Through her we can experience oneness, the bigger picture, and connect with all that is.&quot;</p>

                <p>&quot;The Crone: (surrendering ego) This is a very wise woman, no longer focused on others she has turned her reflections inward, as the Maiden did. She is not detached from the world; just not involved in the ways she was before. She seeks more solitude. Others seek her out for guidance and she welcomes them. She has a wide perspective, gained from years of experience...She can be completely honest because she has nothing to lose. She holds the wisdom, teaches and shares stories with those who will listen.</p>

                <p>The dark aspects of the Crone: She can be bitter if she did not complete actualization of the previous stages of life, making it difficult for her to let go of her youth, dreams, people and living in the body. She may isolate herself and may blame others for her misfortunes. Her rage can be fiery. Her sadness and pain deep.</p>

                <p>The Croneâ€™s job: She is hopefully fulfilled by a life well lived, dreams and visions actualized. Her children, if any, are grown. Her responsibilities have moved into the arena of sharing the knowledge that she has acquired and she welcomes the invitation to share it. She returns the seed of vision back to the Maiden. Within her is a lively Maiden and a creative Mother. Our culture tends to devalue our elders, retiring them from work and often from the family and life in general. We lose so much of ourselves, within and without when we lose connection with the wisdom of the Crone.&quot;</p>

                <h3 class="black_jack">Wise Woman</h3>
                <p>&quot;I knew a Wise Woman
                    <br>And she said to me
                    <br>That the river would mold me
                    <br>And the wild wind would cool me
                    <br>That the trickster the coyote He would fool me
                    <br>That father Sun would warm me
                    <br>Mother Earth would clothe me
                    <br>Grandmother Moon would greet me
                    <br>And of the old ways she would teach me
                    <br>Wise woman, she told me
                    <br>To always walk lightly
                    <br>Tread the Earth ever gently
                    <br>Lovingly so preciously
                    <br>And take from her sparingly
                    <br>She said, to share with others
                    <br>What you have learned from me
                    <br>Be still and breathe, ever patiently
                    <br>For the web of life
                    <br>Has woven what is to be
                    <br>But you must still choose
                    <br>Your own path, you will see
                    <br>And lastly, the Wise Woman said to me
                    <br>To listen to the Wise one
                    <br>That dwells within me
                    <br>To walk my path in balance
                    <br>Is to be free...&quot;</p>
