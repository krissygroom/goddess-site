                <p>&quot;The Queen is the archetype of the Autumn harvest which provides us with wisdom, cohesion, integration, and fulfillment. Through her influence we cultivate our own inner guidance system, learning what to let go of and what to embrace as we move toward wholeness.&quot;</p>

                <p>&quot;The Queen: (mastering ego) The queen can be seen as the later phase of the mother archetype. She is a woman owning her own power and authority within herself and in the world. If she had children they are now older allowing her greater focus on her other creations. This is a woman negotiating her responsibility and power and reveling in all that she has mastered and accomplished. She has much to teach and remains actively engaged in society, either directly or through her teachings. She is renegotiating the all encompassing giving of the mother and creating clearer boundaries around herself, her time and her expenditure of energies. She reaps the benefits personally of all she has done and directs more of her power and attention to her own needs and creations. This can be a powerful personal, spiritual, and political stage of her life.</p>

                <p>The dark aspects of the Queen: - The powerful queen can abuse her power and direct her knowledge and status for negative purposes, clinging to all she has achieved, becoming consumed with acquiring more and more power. She may respond to her sense of personal, familial or social responsibilities by withdrawing and withholding. If she did not experience a positive mother phase she may feel drained, resentful and misdirect her anger. She may not feel she has anything to offer this stage of life.</p>

                <p>The Queens' job: To renegotiate her boundaries, realize and actualize her power and knowledge, and use her expertise for the good of all. This might be difficult for her if she lives in a patriarchal culture that devalues women and is threatened by her power.&quot;</p>

                <h3 class="black_jack">A Queen</h3>

                <p>&quot;A Queen is proud of herself. She respects herself and others.
                    <br>She is aware of who she is. She neither seeks definition from
                    <br>the person she is with, or does she expect them to
                    <br>read her mind. She is quite capable of
                    <br>articulating her needs.</p>

                <p>A Queen is hopeful. She is strong enough to make all her
                    <br>dreams come true..... She knows love, therefore she
                    <br>gives love. She recognizes that her love has
                    <br>great value and must be reciprocated.
                    <br>If her love is taken for granted,
                    <br>it soon disappears.</p>

                <p>A Queen has a dash of inspiration, a dabble of endurance.
                    <br>She knows that she will, at times, have to inspire others
                    <br>to reach the potential God gave them. A Queen knows
                    <br>her past, understands her present and
                    <br>moves toward the future.</p>

                <p>A Queen knows the Creative Energy. She knows that with
                    <br>this the world is her playground, but without she will just
                    <br>be played. A Queen does not live in fear of the future
                    <br>because of her past. Instead, she understands that
                    <br>her life experiences are merely lessons, meant
                    <br>to bring her closer to self knowledge
                    <br>and unconditional self love.
                    <br>Queen,
                </p>
